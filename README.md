# Twilio-Plugin
The Twilio Plugin is meant to show the possibilities of the Hooks feature implemented in Empire 4.1.
It isn't particularly useful in its current state.

## Install
Prerequisites:
- Empire >=4.1.0

1. Add twilioplugin.py to the plugins folder of Empire.
2. `poetry add twilio`

## Usage
From the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console), get your Account SID, authentication token, and phone number.
Add them to the plugin, and set enabled to `True`!
